# Problem 1
## NumPy (Numerical Python) 
Purpose: NumPy is fundamental for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things a powerful N-dimensional array object and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.
    - `numpy.array()`: Creates an n-dimensional array. It is the foundation of NumPy, allowing for the performance of mathematical operations on arrays.
    - `numpy.linspace()`: Returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified range, and it’s quite helpful in generating data points for plotting.
## Pandas
Purpose: Pandas offer data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series, which makes it suitable for data cleaning and analysis.
    - `pandas.DataFrame()`: A two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).
    - `pandas.read_csv()`: Reads a comma-separated values (csv) file into DataFrame, a common method for importing data from spreadsheets or databases.
## Matplotlib
Purpose: Matplotlib is a 2D plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
    - `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`: Basic plotting function that allows for the creation of a variety of plots quickly.
    - `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()`: Creates a new figure, which can be useful when generating multiple plots in the same script.

# Problem 2
API: OpenWeatherMap API
Type of API: RESTful API
What it does: Provides weather data, which includes current weather, forecasts, nowcasts and historical weather data for any location in the world.
Unique Feature: It has a One Call API endpoint that allows you to retrieve current, minutely, hourly, and daily weather forecasts using a single API call.
Brainstorm Scenario: A potential application could be a personalized daily weather forecast notification system. Users receive notifications about the weather conditions of the day at their location, helping them plan their daily activities better.

# Problem 3
```python
import numpy as np  # Importing the numpy library and giving it a prefix np

# Creating an array of 10 numbers
array = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])  

# Using a prefixed function (np.mean)
# Calculating the mean of the array
mean_value = np.mean(array)  # The mean_value will hold the average of the numbers in the array

# Using a prefixed variable (np.pi)
# Creating an array of numbers multiplied by pi
array_times_pi = array * np.pi  # np.pi represents the mathematical constant π (pi)

# Displaying the results
print(f"Original array: {array}")
print(f"Mean of the array: {mean_value}")
print(f"Array multiplied by pi: {array_times_pi}")
```
