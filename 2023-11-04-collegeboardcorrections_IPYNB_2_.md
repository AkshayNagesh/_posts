# College Board Test Corrections

## Question 61



I chose option A: I and II

The correct answer was D: II and III

The procedure will initially sort the data, proceed to maintain only the palindromes, and subsequently carry out the truncation step. This order guarantees that the truncation is applied exclusively to the sorted palindromes. The assertion in option I that indicates the truncation step would occur prior to the selection of palindromes is not correct.

## Question 63

Line 4 should be removed because if the count is set to 0 inside the loop then the function will not give an accurate number of prime numbers in the list.

I chose line 7 which was incorrect.

Line 9 should also be removed because you should only increase the count of prime numbers in a list if the number is prime. If you increase it outside then it doesn't matter if the number is prime or not.
